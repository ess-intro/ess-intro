# Topic lists

## Moving over to GitHub

 - Let's try to have more discussion in the wiki at https://github.com/ess-intro/ess-intro/wiki

 - Per-subject pages at the wiki
   - Topics https://github.com/ess-intro/ess-intro/wiki/Topics
   - Style https://github.com/ess-intro/ess-intro/wiki/Style

## Overall Idea:

 - First things first.  We need to show how to install, edit a file, run some code. 
 
 - Focus on B. A. S. I. C. S. first before we go off to more esoteric stuff (looking 
   at you, tramp or org mode or nix or window managers)
   
 - The intended audience
   DE: Anybody interested in using Emacs along with R. And I would strongly prefer to not position 
       this as 'alternative' or 'against'. Let's just talk about ESS as a way to do R. Others have 
       others preferences (Eclipse/StatEt, VSCode, Atom, ...).  It's not "us vs them". It's about ESS.
      
## From the top of my head I can think of possible topics such as (--> now at https://github.com/ess-intro/ess-intro/wiki/Topics)

 0 **Please** bring this discuss over to the new location https://github.com/ess-intro/ess-intro/wiki/Topics

 1 installing ESS (possibly special mention to the bundles by VG for Windows
   and macOS, or KH for social science, or ...) -- no difficulty installing 
   
 2 maybe different Emacs frontends and ESS?  Spacemacs, Doom, vile, ...  Does anybody here
   use one of them and could show the use? (SB: I don't) [AZ: If a spacemacs 
   user is needed I could put together a couple of slides] [CW: if AZ puts spacemacs together, I could provide parallel version for doom] [AZ: sounds good to me CW, do the following sound suitable to you?]
   a. Motivation for <your emacs>, i.e., spacemacs is emacs + vim
   b. What ESS looks like in <your emacs>.
   c. How to learn more about <your emacs>.
   DE Very good stuff.  Can you pretty-please carry this and other updates you make (or made) to https://github.com/ess-intro/ess-intro/wiki/Topics

 3 basic editing, highlighting etc maybe up to easily running multiple
   buffers and renaming them, auto*magic* indentation and color highlighting etc pp. 
   Working with sexp (C-M-f C-M-b C-M-k)
   C-x n d (narrow to defun) useful for code renaming in re-factoring functions.
   
 4 basic selection and running of code: line, region, function, buffer (without
   getting lost in too long an Emacs sermon -- this may be a 5 min topic)
   
 5 invoking help (on functions, objects, ...), running examples from help
 
 6 additional customization for ESS: auto-completion with company / company-quickhelp,
   syntax checking with Flycheck, configuring buffer display, Rdired, etc. [FS]

 7 other relevant Emacs tricks ?
   - see suggestions on i) org-mode ii) magit

 8 ESS and RMarkdown, polymode [TS] examples / demos
   - ESS and Rnw too (CR)

 9 package building with ESS (can share my workflow [AD])
   (Suggestion: simple demo, five mins are filled easily and quickly. Deeper comparisons to 
    alternative approaches may best be left for another day)
  
10 package documentation with roxygen2 via ESS (part of package building ? [AD])
 
11 debugging with ESS
 
12 git via magit (magit is supercool, but is there sth. special about ESS/magit? DS)
 
13 other Emacs voodoo like tramp use with ESS ? [CW: I could try and show this]

14 object browsers, Rdired, ... 

15 your most favourite trick here!

16 your second most favourite trick here too!
 
17 Auto-formatting code
   + does this already exist in ESS? 
    (DE: I say it exists and is a basic topic for above yes, 
     see https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#R-coding-standards)

18 blogging with Emacs, RMarkdown, Blogdown, Hugo, ESS, ... (DE: This needs focus,
   at present it is entire second series of talks beyond this one)
   (TS: I agree this is too much to cover comprehensively. I do think there could be value in 
    demonstrating how blogging works with these tools. The objective would be to show what is possible, 
    and how easy it is to use. That might motivate the audience to look into how to do it, or lead to a 
    follow up series with detailed instruction on the different components)
   (DE: Not to dampen your energy and enthusiasm but that "give a teaser and hope people study more" is 
    true of every topic and lecture, in essence.  And why we want a "5 minute limit".)
   (GM: i do think that, for someone coming from the outside, seeing someone with a seamless flow generating a data-, graph-full
    blog page might well convince them to think, "oh, you can do *that*, that easily?  let's look some more".  but, maybe just as a teaser, not so much instructional?)
   (DE: Sure. I just do not think you can do it well enough in five mins given all the details. Happy to be proven wrong :) )
  
19 ESS and org mode [GM]
   + life in an ESS Org Src buffer (GM)
   
20 (Possible duplicate of point 2) ESS and Emacs for VI users ?  Anybody use Vile or Spacemacs?  
 
## Topics that are 'too far out' for a first round 
 
 - ESS and EXWM (if I [SJE] get a decent workflow)
 
 - ESS and nix (DE: too esoteric, would like focus on cross-platform cross-OS here)
 
 - ESS and LSP-mode (SJE: probably too advanced)
 
## Meta
 
 - How would we go about suggesting a _minimal_ but working .emacs for ESS work? Cover it 
   in installation? [TS]
 
 - Questions .emacs vs. Preferences.el 
 
## Next Steps
 
 - GitHub 'organization' to regroup different repos, one each per talk, room for experimentation etc
   [DONE] See https://github.com/ess-intro/
 
 - Or just one GitHub (or GitLab) repo with links to talks repos?
 
 - Other ideas?  Please edit here in this page possibly by opening new sections below ...
 
 - Is there a default license to use in the github repos?  
   DE: Not per se (for GitHub that is). I use GPL (>= 2), but I would any standard license that works on CRAN works for us. Content creators own copyright. 
 
## Who is willing to do what? [GM]
 
 - multiple volunteers for same topic perfectly okay [GM, DE]
 
 - may I suggest we put "initials in a square box" next to the topic(s) we could cover above?  [DE] [ggm]

 - (..... *please* add new entries at the bottom here and copy this along -- latency experience for collabedit may vary in different spots ....)
  
## Misc
 
 - RS: We need to have links in one central location such as 
   <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSpeaksStatistics>
   where users are likely to find this.  
   A YouTube channel would be a good idea.  
   I can add links to this material from the ESS home page.
