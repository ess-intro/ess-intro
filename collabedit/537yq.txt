# Topic lists

## Overall Idea:

 - First things first.  We need to show how to install, edit a file, run some code. 
 
 - Focus on B. A. S. I. C. S. first before we go off to more esoteric stuff (looking 
   at you, tramp or org mode or nix or window managers)
      
## From the top of my head I can think of possible topics such as

 1 installing ESS (possibly special mention to the bundles by VG for Windows
   and macOS, or KH for social science, or ...) -- no difficulty installing 
   
 2 maybe different Emacs frontends and ESS?  Spacemacs, Doom, ...  Does anybody here
   use one of them and could show the use? (SB: I don't) [AZ: If a spacemacs 
   user is needed I could put together a couple of slides]

 3 basic editing, highlighting etc maybe up to easily running multiple
   buffers and renaming them, auto*magic* indentation and color highlighting etc pp. 
   Working with sexp (C-M-f C-M-b C-M-k)
   C-x n d (narrow to defun) useful for code renaming in re-factoring functions.
   
 4 basic selection and running of code: line, region, function, buffer (without
   getting lost in too long an Emacs sermon -- this may be a 5 min topic)
   
 5 invoking help (on functions, objects, ...), running examples from help
 
 6 additional customization for ESS: auto-completion with company / company-quickhelp,
   syntax checking with Flycheck, configuring buffer display, Rdired, etc. [FS]

 7 other relevant Emacs tricks ?
   - SB: getting electric pair to work properly? I have never succeeded in that and disabled it. 
   - also see suggestions on i) org-mode ii) magit

 8 ESS and RMarkdown, polymode [TS] examples / demos
   - ESS and Rnw too (CR)

 9 package building with ESS (can share my workflow [AD])
   (Suggestion: simple demo, five mins are filled easily and quickly. Deeper comparisons to 
    alternative approaches may best be left for another day)
  
10 package documentation with roxygen2 via ESS (part of package building ? [AD])
 
11 debugging with ESS
 
12 git via magit (magit is supercool, but is there sth. special about ESS/magit? DS)
 
13 other Emacs voodoo like tramp use with ESS ?

14 object browsers, Rdired, ... 

15 your most favourite trick here!

16 your second most favourite trick here too!
 
17 Auto-formatting code
   + does this already exist in ESS? 
    (DE: I say it exists and is a basic topic for above yes, 
     see https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-ints.html#R-coding-standards)

18 blogging with Emacs, RMarkdown, Blogdown, Hugo, ESS, ... (DE: This needs focus,
   at present it is entire second series of talks beyond this one)
   (TS: I agree this is too much to cover comprehensively. I do think there could be value in 
    demonstrating how blogging works with these tools. The objective would be to show what is possible, 
    and how easy it is to use. That might motivate the audience to look into how to do it, or lead to a 
    follow up series with detailed instruction on the different components)
   (DE: Not to dampen your energy and enthusiasm but that "give a teaser and hope people study more" is 
    true of every topic and lecture, in essence.  And why we want a "5 minute limit".)
   (GM: i do think that, for someone coming from the outside, seeing someone with a seamless flow generating a data-, graph-full
    blog page might well convince them to think, "oh, you can do *that*, that easily?  let's look some more".  but, maybe just
    as a teaser, not so much instructional?)
   (DE: Sure. I just do not think you can do it well enough in five mins given all the details. Happy to be proven wrong :) )
  
19 ESS and org mode [GM]
   + life in an ESS Org Src buffer (GM)
   
20 (Possible duplicate of point 2) ESS and Emacs for VI users ?  Anybody use Vile or Spacemacs?  
 
## Topics that are 'too far out' for a first round 
 
 - ESS and EXWM (if I [SJE] get a decent workflow)
 
 - ESS and nix (DE: too esoteric, would like focus on cross-platform cross-OS here)
 
 - ESS and LSP-mode (SJE: probably too advanced)
 
## Meta
 
 - How would we go about suggesting a _minimal_ but working .emacs for ESS work? Cover it 
   in installation? [TS]
 
 - Questions .emacs vs. Preferences.el 
 
## Next Steps
 
 - GitHub 'organization' to regroup different repos, one each per talk, room for experimentation etc
   [DONE] See https://github.com/ess-intro/
 
 - Or just one GitHub (or GitLab) repo with links to talks repos?
 
 - Other ideas?  Please edit here in this page possibly by opening new sections below ...
 
## Who is willing to do what? [GM]
 
 - multiple volunteers for same topic perfectly okay [GM, DE]
 
 - may I suggest we put "initials in a square box" next to the topic(s) we could cover above?  [DE] [ggm]
 
## Who is who (add GitHub handles to join GH org)
 
 - DE: Dirk Eddelbuettel (@eddelbuettel), 25 years of Emacs and zero skill in Elisp, Emacs for R, C/C++, (ma)git, sh, Markdown, Life, The Universe, .... 
 
 - DS: Detlef Steuer, 15 years of Emacs and still a clueless beginner, R since before 0.50, orgmode
 
 - FS: Frédéric Santos, ~2 years of Emacs, "advanced beginner" in Elisp, 
       daily use of ESS, and org mode with polymode.
 
 - AZ: Alex Zarebski, ~2 years Spacemacs, pretty satisfied with my org + ESS
       setup but always looking to learn a bit more.
 
 - GM: Greg Minshall: 25 years of emacs, staggers in elisp; org+R ==> ESS
 
 - TS: Tyler Smith, 16 years of Emacs and ESS, competent Elisp, heavy user of org, polymode, RMarkdown 
  
 - RS: Rodney Sparapani, 22 years of emacs and developer of ESS 
       since 1998.  Would like to talk about Roxygen
       
 - SB: Stephen Bond, 15 years of ESS usage, basic Elisp, basic org, RMarkdown, Fortran, python
 
## Misc
 
 - RS: We need to have links in one central location such as 
   <https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsSpeaksStatistics>
   where users are likely to find this.  
   A YouTube channel would be a good idea.  
   I can add links to this material from the ESS home page.
